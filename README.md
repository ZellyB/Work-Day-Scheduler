Features that were included based on the criteria given include being able to see the current day displayed at the top of the calendar, time blocks that run from 7AM to 5PM, with each time block dynamically showing whether each time block is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks in to a time block they are able to enter a calendar event that they want to remember. By clicking the save button on the right of that time block they are able to save that event. When the user saves their entry they are presented with a nice animation that indicates that the event has been saved. If the user were to refresh, or close the page, upon reopening the application they will be presented with any events that they previously saved.
